# Casting the Runes - OneGameAMonth - July 2013

## Overview
A simple memory game. A sequence of tiles are displayed, selected from a
set of tiles. They are then hidden, and the player must 'replay' the
sequence to win the round.

## Dependencies

* [jaws - Javascript graphics library](https://github.com/ippa/jaws)

I've included the library in the src directory so that this project contains
the correct version of it, in case later versions introduce breaking changes
(though as it hasn't been updated recently, this seems unlikely).
